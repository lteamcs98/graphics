<h1 id="abstraction-functions-graphics-and-coding-style">Abstraction, functions, graphics, and coding style</h1>
<h2 id="abstraction-the-value-of-temporary-ignorance">Abstraction: The value of (temporary) ignorance</h2>
<p>When we build higher-level concepts from simpler pieces and then work with those higher-level concepts, we are taking advantage of <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction is a major tool in computer science that we'll come back to over and over.</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction hides the details of how things work.</strong> Functions are our first example of abstraction. Look at this program, in <a href="abstraction.js">abstraction.js</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">function</span> revenge(){<br />    print(<span class="st">&quot;You killed my father.&quot;</span>);  <br />    print(<span class="st">&quot;Prepare to die.&quot;</span>);  <br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">function</span> greet(){<br />    print(<span class="st">&quot;Hello.&quot;</span>);  <br />    print(<span class="st">&quot;My name is Inigo Montoya.&quot;</span>);  <br />}<br /><br />greet();<br />revenge();  <br />greet(); <br />revenge();</code></pre>
<p>We defined two functions, each in terms of a sequence of simpler commands. Once we defined those functions, we were able to just use them without thinking (too much) about how they worked.</p>
<p>Abstraction helps us in areas beyond computer science. For example, when I press the gas pedal on my car, a lot of stuff happens, but because I have the higher-level &quot;push-gas-pedal-car-moves&quot; concept, I don't have to think about the details of what is going on in the drive train (engine, transmission, differential, etc.) to make my car go.</p>
<p>Try this exercise some time: consider some other course you have taken, and identify where abstraction came into play.</p>
<h2 id="calling-a-library-function">Calling a library function</h2>
<p>Here's another big win for functions. You can use a function <em>someone else</em> wrote, without knowing exactly the internal details of the function. Let's look at an example where <a href="datetime_test.js">datetime_test.js</a> uses a function from  <a href="simplefunctions.js">simplefunctions.js</a>.
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode javascript">load("simplefunctions.js");<br /><br />print_date_and_time();</code></pre>
<p>The first line says that this program will use the <code>print_date_and_time</code> function from the <code>simplefunctions</code> library of functions. (In Python, such a library is called a <strong>module</strong>.) The program then calls the <code>print_date_and_time</code> function. When this function is called, the interpreter saves the current value of the program counter, sets the program counter to the beginning of the print_date_and_time function somewhere in the <code>simplefunctions</code> module, executes the code it finds there, and then resets the program counter to the original, saved value.</p>
<h2 id="functions-that-take-parameters">Functions that take parameters</h2>
<p>Just like the print command, functions can take <strong>parameters</strong>: additional information that influences what the function does. This code, in <a href="sqrt_text.js">sqrt_text.js</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode javascript">load("simplefunctions.js"); <br /><br />print_sqrt(<span class="dv">4</span>);<br />print_sqrt(<span class="dv">9</span>);</code></pre>
<p>prints the following to the console window:</p>
<pre><code>2
3
</code></pre>
<p>When making a function call, we write the values of the parameters inside the parentheses. We say that we <strong>pass</strong> the parameters to the function at the point of call. Functions may take multiple parameters, in which case we separate them by commas when we call the function. Here's an example, in <a href="simple_graphics.js">simple_graphics.js</a>. Make sure that you have cs1lib.py in your project.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode javascript">clear();<br /><br />draw_circle(<span class="dv">125</span>, <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dv">50</span>);<br />draw_circle(<span class="dv">275</span>, <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dv">50</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Let's look at what happens here. First, the function <code>clear</code> clears the window. Second, we call the function <code>draw_circle</code>, passing it three parameters. The first parameter, 125, says to draw the circle at <em>x</em> coordinate 175 in the window. The second parameter, 100, says to use the <em>y</em> coordinate 100. The third parameter, 50, says that the radius of the circle should be 50. The final line calls the <code>draw_circle</code> function again, with different parameters.</p>
<h2 id="graphics-coordinates">Graphics coordinates</h2>
<p>We glossed over what the coordinates passed to the <code>draw_circle</code> functions really mean. When we open a window for graphics, there's a coordinate system within the window. Coordinate correspond to pixels in the window, with (0, 0) at the upper left corner of the window. The coordinates (125, 100) mean the pixel that is 125 pixels to the right and 100 pixels below the upper left corner.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: starting from the upper left corner of the graphics window, <em>x</em> coordinates increase to the right, and <em>y</em> coordinates increase down from the top. If you think about how <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates usually work in mathematics, graphics on a computer doesn't quite match up. The <em>x</em> direction works, but in math, increasing <em>y</em> coordinates go <em>up</em>, whereas in computer graphics, increasing <em>y</em> coordinates go <em>down</em>.</p>
<p>What do the parameters passed to <code>draw_circle</code> mean? The first two parameters give the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of the circle's center, and the third coordinate gives the circle's radius in pixels. Here's a simple exercise for you to try: What would you see if you called <code>draw_circle(0, 0, 100)</code>?</p>
<h2 id="good-coding-style">Good coding style</h2>
<p>Computer programs are not just for computers. Good code should do two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It should allow the computer to solve a useful or interesting problem.</li>
<li>It should describe a solution to the problem in a way that a human reader can understand it.</li>
</ol>
<p>A well-written program is more than a machine for solving a problemâ€”it is in a real sense a description of a solution to a problem. How to write good, human-readable code is a major focus of this course, and we'll come back to it again and again.</p>
<p>Let's look at the following bad program, in <a href="bad_program.py">bad_program.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ch">from</span> cs1lib <span class="ch">import</span> *<br /><span class="kw">def</span> whatever():<br />    clear()<br />    disable_stroke()<br />    set_fill_color(<span class="dv">0</span>,.<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>)<br />    draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">300</span>,<span class="dv">400</span>,<span class="dv">100</span>)<br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">5</span>,.<span class="dv">4</span>,.<span class="dv">2</span>) <br />    draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">200</span>,<span class="dv">250</span>,<span class="dv">130</span>,<span class="dv">100</span>)  <br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">3</span>,.<span class="dv">3</span>,.<span class="dv">3</span>)  <br />    draw_triangle(<span class="dv">200</span>,<span class="dv">250</span>,<span class="dv">330</span>,<span class="dv">250</span>,<span class="dv">265</span>,<span class="dv">200</span>)<br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">6</span>,.<span class="dv">5</span>,.<span class="dv">3</span>)  <br />    draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">280</span>,<span class="dv">310</span>,<span class="dv">25</span>,<span class="dv">40</span>)<br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">9</span>,.<span class="dv">8</span>,.<span class="dv">2</span>) <br />    draw_circle(<span class="dv">300</span>,<span class="dv">330</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>)<br />start_graphics(whatever)</code></pre>
<p>What does this program do? Does it describe how to solve a problem? What's the problem? Is this is a good solution? Could you modify it easily to solve a more interesting problem, without even knowing what the program does?</p>
<p>In this case, the program is short and you could figure out what it does by running it with Python. It would still be a lot of work to figure out what each line of code was intended to do just from reading the code without running it.</p>
<p>(One sidenote: &quot;<code>from cs1lib import *</code>&quot; tells Python that you want to be able to use every function from the <code>cs1lib</code> module, freeing us from having to specify each individual function we intend to use. The downside of using the <code>*</code> notation is that Eclipse will warn us about all the functions in cs1lib.py that we do <em>not</em> use. But this is a warning that we may safely ignore.)</p>
<h3 id="explaining-your-code-with-comments">Explaining your code with comments</h3>
<p>You can use the <code>#</code> symbol in Python code to indicate code that Python should ignore. On a line of code, everything after the pound symbol is called a <strong>comment</strong> and is ignored by Python; it's there just for human readers.</p>
<p>Here's an example, in <a href="house_good.py">house_good.py</a>, where we improve the above program by adding comments and whitespace, and by using a more descriptive function function name. By <strong>whitespace</strong>, we mean spaces, tabs, and &quot;newlines.&quot; Whitespace helps human readers understand the structure of a program, much as breaking prose into chapters, sections, and paragraphs helps readers understand the structure of a book.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># Program to draw a simple house</span><br /><span class="co"># cs1 example of use of commenting and whitespace</span><br /><span class="co"># author Devin Balkcom</span><br /><span class="co"># July, 2011</span><br /><br /><span class="ch">from</span> cs1lib <span class="ch">import</span> *<br /><br /><span class="co"># Function to draw a house.</span><br /><span class="kw">def</span> draw_house():<br /><br />    clear()<br />    disable_stroke()<br /><br />    <span class="co"># draw the lawn</span><br />    set_fill_color(<span class="dv">0</span>, .<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="co"># dark green</span><br />    draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">300</span>, <span class="dv">400</span>, <span class="dv">100</span>)<br /><br />    <span class="co"># draw the main square part of the house</span><br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">5</span>, .<span class="dv">4</span>, .<span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="co"># brown</span><br />    draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">200</span>, <span class="dv">250</span>, <span class="dv">130</span>, <span class="dv">100</span>)  <br /><br />    <span class="co"># draw the roof</span><br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">3</span>, .<span class="dv">3</span>, .<span class="dv">3</span>)  <span class="co"># gray</span><br />    draw_triangle(<span class="dv">200</span>, <span class="dv">250</span>, <span class="dv">330</span>, <span class="dv">250</span>, <span class="dv">265</span>, <span class="dv">200</span>)<br /><br />    <span class="co"># draw the door</span><br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">6</span>, .<span class="dv">5</span>, .<span class="dv">3</span>)  <span class="co"># light brown</span><br />    draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">280</span>, <span class="dv">310</span>, <span class="dv">25</span>, <span class="dv">40</span>)<br /><br />    <span class="co"># draw the doorknob</span><br />    set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">9</span>, .<span class="dv">8</span>, .<span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="co"># gold</span><br />    draw_circle(<span class="dv">300</span>, <span class="dv">330</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)<br /><br />start_graphics(draw_house)</code></pre>
<p>We can now see exactly what the program is intended to do, and also which lines of code accomplish which parts of the solution.</p>
<p>How much should you comment your own code? Here are some guidelines:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Always put a comment at the top of the program or file describing the overall intent and how the program works.</li>
<li>Always put a comment before the beginning of each function you define, indicating the purpose.</li>
<li>Always comment something that might be mysterious to even an experienced programmer</li>
</ol>
<p>Good comments add new information, but that does not mean you should comment every single line of code. Here's a distracting comment that is <em>not</em> useful:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">280</span>, <span class="dv">310</span>, <span class="dv">25</span>, <span class="dv">40</span>)     <span class="co"># draw a rectangle</span></code></pre>
<p>We can see from the function name that this line draws a rectangle. A more useful comment would tell us what we are trying to do with the rectangle (in this case, draw a door). Another comment might tell us the fill color:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># draw the door</span><br />set_fill_color(.<span class="dv">6</span>, .<span class="dv">5</span>, .<span class="dv">3</span>)  <span class="co"># light brown</span><br />draw_rectangle(<span class="dv">280</span>, <span class="dv">310</span>, <span class="dv">25</span>, <span class="dv">40</span>)</code></pre>
<h3 id="more-graphics-functions">More graphics functions</h3>
<p>In the previous example, we saw some new graphics functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>draw_rectangle</code> draws a rectangle, given four parameters. The first two give the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle, the third parameter gives the rectangle's width, and the fourth parameter gives the rectangle's height. So the call <code>draw_rectangle(200, 250, 130, 100)</code> draws a rectangle with an upper left corner at (200, 250) and a lower right corner at (330, 350).</p></li>
<li><p><code>draw_triangle</code> takes six parameters, which it groups into three consecutive pairs. Each pair gives the coordinates of one vertex of the triangle. So the call <code>draw_triangle(200, 250, 330, 250, 265, 200)</code> draws a triangle with vertices at (200, 250), (330, 250), and (265, 200).</p></li>
<li><p><code>set_fill_color</code> says that until told otherwise (by a later call to <code>set_fill_color</code>), we are drawing all filled shapes in the color specified by its three parameters. The parameters give the fraction of red, green, and blue (in that order) that, when mixed together, form the color. White would be (1, 1, 1), black would be (0, 0, 0), pure red would be (1, 0, 0), pure yellow would be (1, 1, 0) (mixing red and green), and so forth. Play with changing the parameters to <code>set_fill_color</code> in the program that draws the house.</p></li>
<li><p><code>disable_stroke</code> just says that when we draw rectangles, circles, and triangles, draw just the inner filled part, not the outline. See what happens if you comment out the call to <code>disable_stroke</code> by putting a <code>#</code> in front of it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-whitespace-well">Using whitespace well</h3>
<p>Python ignores certain types of whitespace, like blank lines and spaces after commas. You should use blank lines to group your code into logical segments. A good rule of thumb is that there should be a blank line roughly every 3-10 lines of code. If you have fewer blank lines, look hard to see whether your code can be broken down into smaller chunks. You can think of these blank lines as serving the same purpose that new paragraphs do in English writing.</p>
<p>It's also good style to put a space after every comma, just as you would in written English.</p>
