User Access Rights

There are three levels of user access to the Interactive Classroom website.

1. Student: Can only view list of challenges assigned by instructor
2. Instructor: Has privileges to add, edit and assign challenges
3. Administrator: In addition to instructor privileges, can edit access rights of other users (i.e. promote them to instructor/admin status)

When the application is first installed, the first user to register will automatically have administrator privileges. Every subsequent user will be automatically registered as a student and will have to be promoted by the admin to become an instructor/administrator.

Administrators promote/demote users by navigating to the User List page and clicking the arrows next to the users' names.
