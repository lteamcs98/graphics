Write the JSON File

To upload a challenge, you must first write a JSON formatted file containing the following information about the challenge:
* the problem
* the title of the challenge
* the test inputs to the challenge
* the correct test outputs
* the function names
* the function headers

In the JSON file, the fields above will be called the following:
* problem
* title
* inputArray and inputs
* outputArray and outputs
* functionNames
* functionHeaders

Let's look at the following challenge JSON file below, "Average of Three":

The order of the fields doesn't matter -- notice how outputArray comes before inputArray in this example. The name-value assignment for JSON and the nesting of arrays are the most crucial components of the JSON file.

The "problem", "title", "functionNames", and "functionHeaders" fields are straightforward. 

*** Need to explain input and output arrays...that's about it. I think everything else is pretty self-explanatory.

To upload your JSON file(s) to the website, navigate to "Add New Challenges", which is available on your admin homepage. Find your JSON file(s) after clicking "Browse" and press "Upload."
