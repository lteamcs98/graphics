							<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
							<h2 id="why-computer-science">Why Computer Science?</h2>
							<p>One reason to take CS 1 is that it gives you your TLA distrib, so that you get a TAS and a lab course. Another reason is the cool professor. Yet another reason is that you'll get to write computer programs that do fun things.</p>
							<p>You might be wondering whether Computer Science is right for you. This course will help you answer that question.</p>
							<h3 id="careers">Careers</h3>
							<p>Maybe you would consider majoring in Computer Science, but you're concerned that the only career option open to CS majors leads to a Dilbert-like job. <em>Not true!!!</em> For one thing, there are many CS jobs that bear no resemblence to Dilbert's existence. Have you heard of a company called Google? They offer free meals—good food, I've tried it—to their employees. Not exactly a Dilbert-like experience.</p>
							<p>Being a CS major opens up possibilites beyond programming jobs. Many CS majors have gone on to medical school, law school, and business school. One of my college roommates—a CS major—is a successful marketing consultant. Another, Dr. Michael First, is editor of the <em>DSM-IV</em>, the standard manual of psychiatric diagnosis, as well as other well-known psychiatry books. Another, Tom Hahn, is a programmer, but definitely not a Dilbert: he works at Pixar, and he has an Academy Award. Dartmouth CS majors have also gone into areas such as teaching and finance.</p>
							<p>Consider a modified major with CS as part of it. Dartmouth students have created modified majors with CS and Engineering, Physics, and Math. Those are no surprise. How about Economics and Geography? Still not a big surprise? OK, how about Philosophy, Music, Film Studies, and Studio Art? Yup, each of these has been done! Even Art History!</p>
							<p>Perhaps it's too late for you to start on a CS major or modified major. But it might not be too late to start on a CS minor. In fact, we had two ’99s who took CS 5 (a previous incarnation of our introductory course) in their junior spring and managed to complete CS minors. One of them was a Classics major, but with her CS minor, she landed a job at Oracle. The other was a Math major who got a Master's degree in CS right here and is now at Cray, a company that makes supercomputers.</p>
							<p>You might also consider a minor in Digital Arts or Computational Methods, or even a major of CS modified with Digital Arts. CS 1 serves as one of the header courses for Digital Arts and Computational Methods.</p>
							<p>I am always happy to talk to you about your career options. So is <script type="text/javascript">

							<h3 id="computer-science-is-artistic">Computer science is artistic</h3>
							<p>Computer science no more about computers than biology is about microscopes, astronomy is about telescopes, or creative writing is about pens or Microsoft Word.</p>
							<p>Computer science is about solving problems, preferably in a beautiful and artistic way. Computers are used in every discipline from medicine (medical robotics, analysis of the spread of disease, design of drugs) to the visual arts; have you seen a Pixar film recently? Computer science is one of the newest disciplines; it has completely transformed our world and will continue to do so.</p>
							<p>Above all else, computer science is a <strong>creative</strong> discipline, mixing some of the best aspects of engineering, art, science, language, and mathematics. Learning about computation will change how you view problems in every discipline, and how you think about solutions to those problems.</p>
							<p>In class, I showed examples of some ideas in computer science, using <a href="Algorithms.pptx">this PowerPoint</a>. We searched for who had my cheese, searched for my phone number in the phone book, and counted up how many people were present in class.</p>
							<h2 id="what-is-this-course-about">What is this course about?</h2>
							<p>You will write a lot of programs in this course. For the first four to five weeks of the term, we'll focus on learning the Javascript programming language. After that, we'll write larger and more exciting programs, but will also look at big ideas in computer science, using programming as a jumping-off point.</p>
							<p>Some of the objectives are to learn how to do the following:</p>
							<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
							<li>Model problems for solution on a computer.</li>
							<li>Analyze the correctness, completeness, and efficiency of solutions to problems.</li>
							<li>Implement solutions, by writing good programs, with good design, structure, and style.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2 id="administrivia">Administrivia</h2>
							<p>Almost all course information will be at the CS 1 website, <a
							href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs1">www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs1</a>.</p>
							<p>Please read the syllabus section of the web pages carefully. In class, we briefly discussed some of the key points from the syllabus, including lecture notes, recitation sections, grading, the schedule, assignments, exams, getting help, and the Academic Honor Principle as it applies to this course. You are responsible for reading the information on the course web pages, and I recommend reading the course text.</p>
							<p>You have <a href="/~cs1/shortassign/logo/sa_logo.html">Short Assignment 1</a> due on Monday. Part of that short assignment has you install the software you're going to use in this course. We have provided details instructions, but you are welcome to come to the <strong>Install-Fest</strong>, tomorrow evening (January 5), 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm, in 003 Sudikoff. Course staff and I will be there to help you install the software on your laptop, assuming of course that you bring your laptop.</p>
							<p>Please download the <a
							href="/~cs1/Questionnaire.doc">questionnaire</a>, which is a Microsoft Word document, fill it out, save it under your name (last name first, so that if your name is Grace Hopper, save it as Hopper, Grace.doc), and <a href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">email it to me</a> as soon as you can. You'll need only a few minutes to fill it out, so please get it to me today or tomorrow if possible. The document uses form fields that you type into, select from a drop-down field, or check.</p>
							<p>In order to set up recitation sections, I need to know when you are available. Please download the <a
							href="/~cs1/section-times.doc">section times</a> document, which is also a Microsoft Word document with form fields. Fill it out, save it, and please <a href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">email it to me</a> by 3:00 pm on Friday. We will make up the recitation sections on Friday afternoon.</p>
							<p>If you say you are definitely available during a one-hour slot, I expect you to honor this commitment. Please take this expectation into account as you make other commitments on and off campus this term.</p>
							<p>You can read most of the rest of the administrivia on the <a
							href="/~cs1/syllabus.html">Syllabus</a> page. Note particularly grading policies, lateness policies, etc.</p>
							<p>

							<p>Let's talk about the Academic Honor Principle. You cannot collaborate or copy in any way on exams. On homeworks, it is fine to discuss approaches with other students. It is fine to help other students find bugs in their code, after both of you have written your own code. But you should write your own code on your own and type it in yourself. Any copying of code from any source other than yourself, without proper attribution—especially, but not limited to, electronic copying—is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. The syllabus page has a lot more on how the Academic Honor Principle applies to CS 1, including some specific examples. You must read it.</p>
							<p>Please make sure that whenever you work on a machine that is not all your own—especially a machine in the lab—that you remove your code when you're all done.</p>
							<h2 id="why-python">Why Javascript?</h2>
							<p>Javascript shares many similarities with other programming languages, including Java and C++, and once you've learned Javascript, these other languages would not be at all difficult to pick up. Javascript is a fairly popular language, and it's also fairly easy to get started with.</p>
							<h2 id="functions.-coding-style.">Functions. Coding style.</h2>
							<p>A computer program is made up of instructions that a computer follows. Let's get started.</p>
							<h2 id="printing-to-the-screen">Printing to the screen</h2>
							<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>);</code></pre>
							<p>This program causes the computer to print the word <code>Hello</code> in the console window at the bottom of the page. Notice that the quotation marks around <code>Hello</code> are not printed.</p>
							<p>Here's another program:</p>
							<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>);<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;my&quot;</span>);<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;name&quot;</span>);<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;is&quot;</span>);<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Inigo&quot;</span>);<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Montoya&quot;</span>);</code></pre>
							<p>In this multi-line program, commands are executed in the order they appear.</p>
							<h2 id="thinking-like-a-computer-the-program-counter">Thinking like a computer: the program counter</h2>
							<p>As the Javascript interpreter runs a program, the interpreter keeps track of the line number that is currently being executed, much as you might use a bookmark to keep track of what page you're reading in a book. The bookmark that the computer uses to keep track of the line number is called the <strong>program counter</strong>.</p>
							<p>The program counter always starts out pointing at the first line of the code in the program you run. It executes that line of code. Depending on what that line of code says, one of two things happens:</p>
							<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
							<li>The program counter increases by one and the interpreter executes the next line of code,</li>
							<li><em>OR</em> the line of code instructs the interpreter to jump to some other line of code, and it sets the program counter appropriately.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Why would we ever want the interpreter to suddenly jump to a new line of code? We'll see many reasons, but the first is to write and use our own commands, called <strong>functions</strong>, that are made up of a chunk of lines of code.</p>
							<p>By giving a name to a chunk of lines of code, we can easily reuse that section of code without having to retype all those lines every time.</p>
							<h2 id="writing-your-own-functions">Writing your own functions</h2>
							<p>Here's a program that defines our own two functions, <code>say_introduction</code> and <code>threaten_vengeance</code>.</p>
							<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">function</span> say_introduction() {<br />    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;My name is Inigo Montoya.&quot;</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">function</span> threaten_vengeance(){<br />    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;You killed my father.&quot;</span>);<br />    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Prepare to die.&quot;</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello.&quot;</span>);</code></pre>
							<p>Function definitions have two parts: a <strong>header</strong>, and a <strong>body</strong>. The header gives the name of the function you want to define (as well as some other things we'll see later).
							<p>The header uses <code>function</code>, the name of the function you'd like to define, parentheses after the name of the function, and a left curly brace. <code>function</code> is an example of a <strong>keyword</strong> in Javascript: a word that has special meaning in a program. Keywords in Javascript may not be used for any other purpose; for example, you cannot give a function the name <code>function</code>.</p>
							<p>So the header for the first function is</p>
							<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">function</span> say_introduction() {</code></pre>
							<p>The body of the first function is</p>
							<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;My name is Inigo Montoya.&quot;</span>);</code></pre>
							<p>When we run the complete program, we get the output:</p>
							<pre><code>Hello.</code></pre>
							<p>Wait. Our program only printed <code>Hello.</code>. Javascript now knows how to do the <code>say_introduction</code> and <code>threaten_vengeance</code> functions, but we haven't told it to use them yet.</p>
							<p>To tell the interpreter to actually run the body of a function, you use a <strong>function call</strong>. To write a function call, write the name of the function followed by parentheses.</p>
							<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">function</span> say_introduction() {<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;My name is Inigo Montoya.&quot;</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">function</span> threaten_vengeance() {<br />    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;You killed my father.&quot;</span>);<br />    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Prepare to die.&quot;</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello.&quot;</span>);<br />say_introduction();<br />threaten_vengeance();<br /><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello.&quot;</span>);<br />threaten_vengeance();</code></pre>
							<p>Here's the output:</p>
							<pre><code>Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Hello.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.</code></pre>
							<p>One way to think of the difference between a function definition and a function call is to think of a cookbook containing various recipes. The printed recipes are like function definitions: they tell <em>how</em> to prepare a dish <em>when</em> you decide to prepare it, but they don't, on their own, cause the dish to be prepared. Actually preparing a dish by following the recipe is like a function call.</p>
							<p>When the program counter reaches a function call, the interpreter takes a note of where the program counter is, moves the program counter to the first line of the body of the appropriate function definition, and executes the lines of code in the function. When the interpreter gets to the end of the body of the function, the program counter is reset to its original value before the function call, and Javascript jumps back to where it started before the function call.</p>
