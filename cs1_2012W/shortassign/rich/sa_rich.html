<p><em>Read the entire assignment before you start designing your program or writing any code.</em></p>
<p>In the year 0 A.D., my ancestor Brutus Cormen deposited <code>$</code>1.00 in the Bank of Rome. (OK, it wasn't a real dollar; it was the Roman equivalent of a dollar. Probably some kind of big coin with a hole in the middle.) The bank promised to pay 5% interest compounded once a year. Each year the bank added to his account 5% of the previous year's balance. In other words, they multiplied his balance by 1.05 once each year, so that at the end of the year 1 A.D., the balance was <code>$</code>1.05; at the end of the year 2 A.D., the balance was <code>$</code>1.1025; at the end of the year 3 A.D., the balance was <code>$</code>1.157625; and so on. Since old Brutus was not around to withdraw it (Julie Caesar's descendants took care of that), the balance has accumulated nicely up to the present day. Because I am his rightful heir, the bank account is now mine. Bwa-ha-ha!!</p>
<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>
<p>Your first job is to write a Python program that computes my current wealth: the balance of the account after 5% interest was compounded 2012 times.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>In an amazing coincidence, our section leader Steffi Ostrowski has an ancestor, Portia Ostrowski, who also deposited money in the Bank of Rome in the year 0 A.D. Back then, the Ostrowskis were much better off than the Cormens, and Portia Ostrowski deposited <code>$</code>100,000.00. But P. O. did not know that in business, you don't get what you deserve—you get what you negotiate—and she was able to get only a 4% interest rate on her deposit, so that her balance multiplied by 1.04 each year.</p>
<p>Your job is to write a Python program that computes the first year in which Brutus's balance exceeds Portia's balance, and prints out that year and the two balances in that year.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-and-how-to-do-it">What to do and how to do it</h2>
<p>You should use variables with names in all-capitals at the top of your program for the initial deposit amounts, interest rates, and for Problem 1, the current year. By convention, variable names in all-capitals indicate that the variable's value should never be changed after the initial assignment.</p>
<p>When you print out balances, they will be large. You will want to store them as floats, and just let the float values print normally. (They should print with scientific notation.) Your output should be nicely formatted. For example, if the current year were year 2 (not year 2012), the output of Problem 1 should read something like</p>
<pre><code>At year 2, the balance is 1.1025.
</code></pre>
<p>Your output does not have to read exactly the same as mine, but it should read like an English sentence with spaces and punctuation in the right places. Remember that you can concatenate strings with the <code>+</code> operator, and you can convert a number to a string with Python's <code>str</code> function. And, of course, you should program your solution to Problem 1 to use the year 2012.</p>
<p>To compute the balances, use while-loops in which each iteration multiplies each balance by the appropriate factor. Do not use exponentiation to calculate balances. Start with the appropriate balances, and use loops to repeatedly multiply the balances by the appropriate amounts each time. Each iteration should correspond to one year.</p>
<p>Submit your programs for the two problems, along with runs that show the answers.</p>
<h2 id="a-helpful-hint">A helpful hint</h2>
<p>I found it quite helpful, when developing my programs, to include a print statement within the body of the loop to show the year and the balances in each iteration of the loop. That way, I could verify that my program was doing the right thing. I then removed the print statement from my loop before declaring my program complete. Of course, I left in a print call after the loop, to print the answer. You should consider doing the same thing, but make sure to remove the print call within the loop body—or comment it out—before submitting your program and its output.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>how_rich.py (or whatever you called the program for Problem 1).</p></li>

<p>Please remember in all assignments that editing the output of the program before printing it is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. Make sure that the output you turn in comes from the program that you turn in. If you make any change to the code, no matter how insignificant you think it might be, rerun your program to produce new output!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-in-your-assignment">How to turn in your assignment</h2>
<p>You have a section leader. That section leader has a special e-mail account</p>
<p>cs1-xxx@cs.dartmouth.edu</p>
<p>where xxx will be replaced with your section leader's first name. So for example, if your section leader is Bertha, then e-mail cs1-bertha@cs.dartmouth.edu. You can find this email account in the Recitation Sections area on the course <a href="https://blackboard.dartmouth.edu/">Blackboard site</a>.</p>
<p>Send your section leader an e-mail with the title &quot;Short assignment 3 submission.&quot; Attach the files that you need to turn in.</p>
