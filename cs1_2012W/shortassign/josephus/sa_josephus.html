<h1 id="short-assignment-11-the-josephus-problem-due-friday-february-17">Short Assignment #11: The Josephus Problem <br />Due: Friday, February 17</h1>
<p>The general Josephus, whose band of 40 soldiers (plus himself) was once faced with certain defeat, proposed the following scheme for the remnants of his army to die honorably by their own hands. He arranged himself and his soldiers in a circle. Then, beginning with a particular soldier, they kept counting around in the circle and killing every other <strong>remaining</strong> soldier until only one remained. Josephus proposed that this last soldier then commit suicide. But he cleverly arranged to be that last soldier himself and slipped away under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>You are to write a program to aid Josephus in figuring out where to stand in the circle. The program should read from the console window two numbers: the number of soldiers <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> and the number <span class="math"><em>k</em></span> skipped between successive executions. <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> should be at least 2, and <span class="math"><em>k</em></span> should be between 1 and <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>, inclusive. The program should then print out the execution order of the soldiers and the last soldier alive. Therefore the &quot;classical&quot; problem would have <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 41</span> (Josephus and 40 followers) and <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 2</span> (every second soldier dies). For <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 5</span> and <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 2</span>, the order of death would be 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, and so Josephus should stand in position 3. For input pair <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 8</span> and <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 4</span>, the order would be 4, 8, 5, 2, 1, 3, 7, 6. Note that the first soldier to die is always soldier number <span class="math"><em>k</em></span>. We call the output a <strong>permutation</strong> of the numbers 1, 2, …, <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>; that is, the output is some rearrangement of the first <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> integers.</p>
<p>Your program should create a circular, doubly linked list using references to maintain the links. <strong>Do not use a sentinel in your circular list.</strong> (Even though we used a sentinel in the circular linked list in class, there is no rule that all circular lists must contain a sentinel.) You can then run around the circle killing off soldiers by removing them from the circular list.</p>
<p>You will probably want to create two classes: one for individual soldiers (like the <code>Node</code> class from lecture), and one for the circle of soldiers (like the <code>Sentinel_DLL</code> class from lecture, but without the sentinel). You may name these classes whatever you like, and write whatever methods you like. You may also put these classes, along with the code that sets everything up and simulates the killing, in a single .py file. (That is, you don't have to make a separate .py file for each class.)</p>
<p>For context, here are the classes and methods that I made. <em>You do not have to write your program the same way that I did. This is merely a suggestion, nothing more, nothing less.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I made a class <code>Soldier</code>, representing an individual soldier. Each <code>Soldier</code> object had instance variables for a number (1 through <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>) and references to the next and previous <code>Soldier</code> object in the circle. Methods: <code>__init__</code> and <code>kill</code>. <code>__init__</code> takes a number as a parameter, and <code>kill</code> takes two strings, a prefix and a suffix to print, surrounding the soldier's number, when the soldier is killed.</p></li>
<li><p>I made a class <code>Army</code>, representing the circle of soldiers. The <code>Army</code> had two instance variables: one counting how many soldiers remain alive, and one referencing the current victim <code>Soldier</code> object. Methods: <code>__init__</code>, <code>advance</code>, and <code>kill_all</code>. <code>__init__</code> takes the total number of soldiers as a parameter, and it creates all the <code>Soldier</code> objects and makes them into a circular, doubly linked list, with the current victim being one of them. <code>advance</code> takes a number as a parameter and advances the current victim by that many remaining soldiers. <code>kill_all</code> kills all the soldiers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generate runs for the following inputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math"><em>n</em> = 5</span>, <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 2</span> <br /><span class="math"><em>n</em> = 16</span>, <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 3</span> <br /><span class="math"><em>n</em> = 41</span>, <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 2</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turn these in with your source code.</p>
<p>Here is the output of my program for <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 5</span> and <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 2</span>:</p>
<pre><code>Enter number n of soliders, at least 2: 5
Enter spacing between victims, between 1 and n: 2
Soldier 2 buys the farm 
Soldier 4 buys the farm 
Soldier 1 buys the farm 
Soldier 5 buys the farm 
The last remaining soldier is 3  
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the beginning and end of my output for <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 41</span> and <span class="math"><em>k</em> = 2</span>:</p>
<pre><code>Enter number n of soliders, at least 2: 41
Enter spacing between victims, between 1 and n: 2
Soldier 2 buys the farm 
Soldier 4 buys the farm 
Soldier 6 buys the farm 
Soldier 8 buys the farm 
Soldier 10 buys the farm 
...
Soldier 27 buys the farm 
Soldier 3 buys the farm 
Soldier 35 buys the farm 
The last remaining soldier is 19  
</code></pre>
<h3 id="historical-note">Historical note</h3>
<p>According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica, Flavius Josephus was a Jewish priest, scholar, and general. He was military commander of Galilee in 66 A.D. and held the fortress of Jotapata against the Romans for 47 days. After the city fell he took refuge with 40 followers in a nearby cave. The followers voted to commit suicide rather than surrender. Josephus disagreed with the decision but feared that he would be murdered if he made his views known. Therefore, he argued that because suicide was immoral, the men should stand in a circle and that each man in turn should kill the man next to the one next to him, around and around the circle, until only one man was left, and then only that man would have to kill himself. He then cleverly arranged to be the last man alive and surrendered to the Romans. (If you want historical accuracy, Josephus also convinced the second-to-last man to surrender rather than be killed, and Brittanica says only that the order was chosen &quot;by lots.&quot;)</p>
