This README explains the directory structure and how to make new short assignments.

Short assignments each have a short name.  For example, the "clock" short assignment.  All files relating the the short assignment are in a directory with that name.  At a minimum, there is a txt file in each directory, sa_xxxx.txt, where xxxx is the name of the short assignment.

Short assignments are NOT numbered, so that it is easier to insert new short assignments or swap assignments out without changing the directory structure.

To make a new short assignment:

1)  Pick a name xxxx
2)  make a new directory xxxx
3)  Write the sa_xxxx.txt file, in xxxx directory
4)  add xxxx/sa_xxxx.html to the list of html files in the Makefile
5)  make clean; svn add xxxx; svn commit
6)  link the short assignment from the short assignments page and on the schedule.
