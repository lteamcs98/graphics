<h1 id="lab-assignment-2-gravity-simulator-due-monday-february-6">Lab Assignment 2: Gravity simulator <br />Due: Monday, February 6</h1>
<p>The goal of this lab is to design and implement a simulator that animates motion of stars, planets, or moons. I'll start by describing the problem in English. First, some definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>body</strong> is the generic term for a star, moon, or planet. A body has a position, a velocity, and a mass.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>system</strong> is the collection of bodies that we want to simulate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have to decide on some units to measure the various quantities. Let's use meters (m), kilograms (kg), and seconds (sec). We'll implement the simulator in only two dimensions, so all positions and velocities will have only <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> components.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example, the Earth-moon system. The Earth-moon system has two bodies. Can you guess what they are? If you said the Earth and the moon, you get a cookie. To start with, we'll put the Earth at the position <span class="math"><em>x</em> = 0</span>, <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 0</span>, although we expect the Earth to move slightly over time as the moon's gravitational force acts on the Earth. We'll also start the Earth standing still, so that its initial velocity components are <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> = 0</span> and <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>y</em></sub> = 0</span>. The Earth has mass of about 5.9736 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg; I looked it up on the Internet.</p>
<p>Where is the moon? I found that the average distance between the center of the Earth and the moon is about 3.844 × 10<sup>8</sup> meters. Because the moon's distance from the Earth changes throughout its elliptical orbit, that's just a rough estimate, but it's good enough for our purposes. So let's start the moon at the position <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> = 3.844 × 10<sup>8</sup> and <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 0</span>. We could start the moon at some other position, but placing the moon initially on the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> axis will simplify the setup.</p>
<p>I found that the speed of the moon is about 1022 meters per second. Remember that velocity has a direction and a magnitude, with speed being the magnitude. The moon's velocity should be in a direction perpendicular to the line from the center of the Earth to the moon, since the orbit of the moon is fairly close to circular:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="moon-orbit.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>So I initialized the velocity of the moon to <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> = 0</span> and <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>y</em></sub> = 1022</span>. The mass of the moon is about 7.3477 × 10<sup>22</sup> kg.</p>
<h2 id="mathematics-and-physics">Mathematics and physics</h2>
<p>Here is a review of some of the mathematics and physics involved in computing the motion of the Earth-moon system. We're going to repeatedly update the positions and velocities of the bodies in the system.</p>
<p>Here's how it will work:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Draw each body at its current position.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the timestep that we would like to update the simulation by for each frame of the animation. Let's say that the frame rate for our simulator is 30 frames per second. But if we moved the simulation at the same rate as the world we live in, it would take a month for the moon to revolve around the Earth. That's well beyond the limit of our patience! So we need some factor by which to speed up the simulation. Let's call this factor the <strong>time scale</strong>. A day is 86,400 seconds long (60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour × 24 hours/day). Suppose that the simulator simulates 100,000 seconds of movement for every second of real time. Then we could watch an entire day of simulated time in under one second. The moon takes approximately 27.3 days to make a full revolution around the Earth, and so we can see one revolution in about 23.6 seconds. The timestep to update the simulation in each frame of the animation would be 100,000 / 30, or about 3333.33 seconds. This will be the timestep for our simulation—the number used to update the velocity (using the acceleration) and to update the position (using the velocity).</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the acceleration of each body. To compute the acceleration of the Earth caused by the moon, we can use the formula</p>
<p><span class="math">$a = \displaystyle \frac{G \; m_{\textrm{moon}}}{r^2}$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math"><em>G</em></span> = 6.67384 × 10<sup>–11</sup> is the universal gravitational constant, <span class="math"><em>m</em><sub>moon</sub></span> is the mass of the moon, and <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> is the distance from the Earth to the moon.</p>
<p>(If you compare this formula with the formula in <a href="../../lectures/lecture09/lecture09.html">Lecture 9</a> for the magnitude of the force exerted by one body upon another, you'll see that the formula here is missing the mass of one of the bodies. That's because here, we're computing acceleration, and <span class="math"><em>f</em> = <em>m</em><em>a</em></span> means <span class="math"><em>a</em> = <em>f</em> / <em>m</em></span>. So we divide out the mass of the body being acted upon to convert from force to acceleration.)</p>
<p>We're not quite done. <em>a</em> is the total amount of the acceleration, but we need to know how much of the acceleration is in the <em>x</em> direction, and how much is in the <em>y</em> direction. If <span class="math"><em>d</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> is the <em>x</em> distance between the Earth and the moon, found by subtracting <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub>moon</sub></span> – <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub>Earth</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>d</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span> is similarly the <em>y</em> distance, we can use these values to compute the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> components <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span> of the acceleration:</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> = <em>a</em> <em>d</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> / <em>r</em></span> , <br /><span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub> = <em>a</em> <em>d</em><sub><em>y</em></sub> / <em>r</em></span></p>
<p>The situation is slightly more complicated if there are more than two bodies in the system. To compute the total <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> acceleration of a body, we add up the <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> contributions of all the other bodies. Let's take as an example the planets in the solar system. The total <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> acceleration of the Earth would be the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> acceleration of the Earth due to the Sun, plus the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> acceleration of the Earth due to Mercury, plus the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> acceleration of the Earth due to Venus, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the velocity of the body using <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span>, and the time step. If the timestep is small enough (and 3333.33 seconds is small enough for our purposes), we can pretend the accelerations are constant throughout the timestep, and multiply <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> by the timestep and add that to <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>. Similarly, multiply <span class="math"><em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span> by the timestep and add that to <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the position of the body using <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span>, and the timestep. That will be the position at which it's drawn at the next timestep.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat starting at step 2.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="design-of-the-python-program">Design of the Python program</h2>
<p>The simulation would be easy to write if we had custom data types to define a body and a system. You could then use methods of the <code>Body</code> and <code>System</code> classes that update positions and velocities using the equations described above and that draw the <code>System</code> and <code>Body</code>. <strong>Your first job is to write the <code>System</code> and <code>Body</code> classes.</strong></p>
<p>To get you started, I've written the code that contains the initial positions and velocities of the Earth and moon, creates <code>Body</code> objects for the Earth and moon, and adds these <code>Body</code> objects to a new <code>System</code>. We then perform the animation.</p>
<p>I recommend that you create a new Eclipse project for this lab assignment. Add cs1lib.py to the Eclipse project, download the file <a href="earthmoon.py">earthmoon.py</a>, and add it to the Eclipse project.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot taken in the midst of the animation:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="earthmoon.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>Of course, earthmoon.py won't work until you've written the <code>Body</code> and <code>System</code> classes.</p>
<h2 id="the-body-class">The <code>Body</code> class</h2>
<p>The <code>Body</code> class represents an individual body, such as the Earth, the moon, the Sun, or any other planet. The version I wrote had four methods:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ot">__init__</span>(<span class="ot">self</span>, mass, x, y, vx, vy, pixel_radius, r, g, b)<br />update_position(<span class="ot">self</span>, timestep)<br />update_velocity(<span class="ot">self</span>, ax, ay, timestep)<br />draw(<span class="ot">self</span>, cx, cy, pixels_per_meter)</code></pre>
<p>The first five parameters (other than <code>self</code>) to the <code>__init__</code> method (<code>mass</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>vx</code>, and <code>vy</code>) describe the physical properties of the body at the start of the simulation. The next parameter (<code>pixel_radius</code>) is the radius of the circle used to draw the body, in pixels. The last three parameters (<code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code>) specify the color in which to draw the body. Although <code>pixel_radius</code> is in pixels, it is used only for drawing the planet and will not be used in the physics calculations in any way. I picked numbers that looked good for my program. For example, for a solar system simulation, I chose the radius of the Earth to be 6 pixels, and of Venus to be 5 pixels.</p>
<p>I will let you figure out the meanings of the parameters to <code>update_position</code> and <code>update_velocity</code> on your own.</p>
<p>The <code>draw</code> method draws the body on the screen, calling <code>draw_circle</code> to actually do the drawing. The parameters <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> represent the location, in pixels, of the center of the simulation. A body at the location <span class="math"><em>x</em> = 0</span>, <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 0</span> should be drawn at the center of the window. Notice that in earthmoon.py, I centered the Earth at <span class="math"><em>x</em> = 0</span>, <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 0</span>, but in order to get the Earth to be drawn in the center of the window, I supplied the values <code>WINDOW_WIDTH / 2</code> and <code>WINDOW_HEIGHT / 2</code> as <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code>. The parameter <code>pixels_per_meter</code> gives the scale of the simulation, and it's used to convert the position of the body (stored in meters) into pixel coordinates in the window. In earthmoon.py, I wanted 10,000,000 meters to scale to 3 pixels, and so the value for this parameter was 3 / 1e7.</p>
<p>You may use the method headers I wrote and write just the bodies of the methods.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>Recall from lecture that if the name of an instance variable or method begins with two underscores, then it is known <em>only</em> to methods in the class in which it appears. This practice promotes abstraction, since it helps to hide details from other classes. Therefore, in <em>my</em> implementation of the <code>Body</code> class, <em>all</em> the instance variables have names beginning with two underscores. For example, I named the instance variable that stores the body's mass <code>__mass</code>.</p>
<p>That's fine, but you will find that methods in other classes need to get the values of at least three of the instance variables of a <code>Body</code> object: its mass, its <em>x</em> position, and its <em>y</em> position. If all the instance variables are inaccessible to code outside the <code>Body</code> class, however, how can methods in other classes get this information?</p>
<p>Easy: just provide methods in the <code>Body</code> class that simply return these values. In addition to the methods listed above, my <code>Body</code> class also has these:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">get_mass()<br />get_x()<br />get_y()</code></pre>
<p>Each of these methods just returns the value of the corresponding instance variable. In object-oriented programming parlance, we call a method that simply returns the value of an instance variable a <strong>getter method</strong>.</p>
<p>In this lab assignment, you don't have to name your instance variables with two leading underscores and provide getter methods, but it's good practice.</p>
<h2 id="the-system-class">The <code>System</code> class</h2>
<p>The <code>System</code> class I wrote had just one instance variable, which was a reference to a list. Each item in the list is a reference to a <code>Body</code> object. Again, in my implementation, I began the name of this instance variable with two underscores, so that <em>only</em> methods in the <code>System</code> class may refer to this instance variable. You don't have to name your instance variable with two underscores at the beginning, but again, it's a good practice.</p>
<p>Code that uses the <code>System</code> class interacts with it through the following methods:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ot">__init__</span>(<span class="ot">self</span>, body_list)<br />update(<span class="ot">self</span>, timestep)<br />draw(<span class="ot">self</span>, cx, cy, pixels_per_meter)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>System</code> class may have more methods than these, but it has to have at least these methods. You'll notice that they're called by code in earthmoon.py. (Of course, <code>__init__</code> is not called directly by code in earthmoon.py, but it is called by the <code>System</code> constructor.)</p>
<p>The <code>draw</code> method of <code>System</code> just calls the <code>draw</code> method on each body in the body list. Like the <code>draw</code> method, you can see a call of the <code>update</code> method in earthmoon.py. The <code>update</code> method computes the accelerations on each body and then calls methods in <code>Body</code> to update the velocity and position of each body.</p>
<p>I wrote another method, <code>__compute_acceleration</code>, in <code>System</code>. This method is called only by <code>update</code> in System, which is why its name begins with two underscores. The <code>__compute_acceleration</code> method computes the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> components of the acceleration of the body at index <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> in the list. (The method takes the index <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> as a parameter.) Remember that to compute the acceleration, you will have to loop over all other bodies to add up their contributions to the acceleration of body <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>A couple of notes about how I implemented <code>__compute_acceleration</code>. First, when looping over the bodies, I had to make sure that I didn't compute the acceleration of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> on itself. So the body of the loop has a check to skip over computing the acceleration of body <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> on itself. Second, <code>__compute_acceleration</code> needs to return not one, but two values: the acceleration in <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and the acceleration in <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>. This requirement presents a little problem: a function can return only one thing, and since a method is a function, a method can return only one thing. So how can I make <code>__compute_acceleration</code> return two values?</p>
<p>It turns out that Python has a structure called a <strong>tuple</strong>, and you can form one just by putting some values in parentheses and separating them by commas. For example, here's a tuple containing the first four prime numbers: (2, 3, 5, 7). A function (or method) is allowed to return a tuple, because a tuple is one &quot;thing.&quot; So you could have <code>__compute_acceleration</code> return a tuple with two values, the accelerations in <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>.</p>
<p>But how do you save these returned values? You can save them into a tuple, and just pull out pieces of the tuple as necessary. For example, you could call <code>__compute_acceleration</code> within <code>update</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">(ax, ay) = <span class="ot">self</span>.__compute_acceleration(n)</code></pre>
<p>And then later on, you can use the variables <code>ax</code> and <code>ay</code> as usual. This tuple feature of Python is very nice for making functions (or methods) that return multiple values. I've often wished that other programming languages provided it.</p>
<h3 id="programming-note-the-draw-methods">Programming note: The <code>draw</code> methods</h3>
<p>Did you notice that I've mentioned two methods, both named <code>draw</code>? One is in the <code>Body</code> class, and it draws a single body. The other is in the <code>System</code> class, and it draws the entire system by drawing each body in the system. When you make a method call and the method name is in more than one class, how do you know which method is being called? <em>Look at the object reference to the left of the dot in the method call.</em> What kind of object does it reference? Whatever kind of object it references gives the class that the method is in.</p>
<p>So, in earthmoon.py, the line</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">earth_moon.draw(WINDOW_WIDTH / <span class="dv">2</span>, WINDOW_HEIGHT / <span class="dv">2</span>, PIXELS_PER_METER)</code></pre>
<p>must call the <code>draw</code> method of the <code>System</code> class, because <code>earth_moon</code> is a reference to a <code>System</code> object.</p>
<h3 id="programming-note-stringing-together-references">Programming note: Stringing together references</h3>
<p>In some of the methods in my <code>System</code> class, I needed to say something like the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the list of bodies that the instance variable references.</li>
<li>Find the <em>i</em>th reference to a body in that list.</li>
<li>Get the <em>x</em>-coordinate of that body.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I write that in Python? Let's tease it out. Suppose that my instance variable, which references a list of references to <code>Body</code> objects, is <code>__body_list</code>. Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To refer to that list, I would write <code>self.__body_list</code>.</li>
<li>To refer to the <em>i</em>th reference in a body to that list, I would write <code>self._body_list[i]</code>.</li>
<li>To get the <em>x</em>-coordinate of that body (assuming that I have to use my getter method), I would write <code>self.__body_list[i].get_x()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that I've strung together three references. <code>self</code> references the <code>System</code> object I'm working on. <code>self.__body_list</code> references a Python list. <code>self.__body_list[i]</code> is a reference to a <code>Body</code> object, so that I can call the <code>get_x</code> method on this <code>Body</code> object by writing <code>self.__body_list[i].get_x()</code>.</p>
<p>Now, if I had chosen to <em>not</em> begin the instance variable <code>x</code> in the <code>Body</code> class with two underscores, then it would have been accessible by methods in the <code>System</code> class, and I would not have needed the <code>get_x</code> method in <code>Body</code>. If I had gone that way, then I could denote the <em>x</em>-coordinate of the <em>i</em>th body in the list by <code>self.__body_list[i].x</code>. Use the same reasoning as before: since <code>self.__body_list[i]</code> references the <em>i</em>th <code>Body</code> object in the list, the <code>x</code> instance variable of this <code>Body</code> object would be <code>self.__body_list[i].x</code>.</p>
<h2 id="part-two-the-solar-system">Part two: The solar system</h2>
<p>Once you have completely written and tested your program with the Earth-moon system, write another Python program, solar.py, that simulates the motion of the Sun and first four planets of the solar system. This should be the last step you take, and it should be similar to the Earth-moon system, except that you will need more bodies and with different values for masses, initial positions, and initial velocities.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/etp/ss/ss_planetdata.html">table</a> on the Internet with the data. The distances are measured in Astronomical Units (the distance of the Earth from the Sun), and the masses are in Earth Masses (the Earth has a mass of 1 EM). You could create a constant global <code>AU</code> that contains the number of meters in one AU (1.49598 × 10<sup>11</sup>), and a similar constant global <code>EM</code> that contains the number of kilograms in one Earth Mass. When creating new bodies, you could just multiply by these constants the to get the correct units for your simulator. The table does not contain the mass of the Sun; use 1.98892 × 10<sup>30</sup> kg.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>
<p>There's a lot to do; it's important to tackle things piece by piece. I would recommend thinking through the design first, seeing how everything will work, and then writing small pieces of the program that you can test. There's no point in writing the whole enchilada and then when it doesn't work, you don't know where to start looking for the bugs. Write a small piece, and test it extensively so that you're satisfied that it works correctly. Then write another small piece, possibly interacting with the first small piece, test this new small piece extensively, and so on. If you operate in this way, when something doesn't work, you'll know that the error is most likely in the newest code you added.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you just want to see the Earth and moon drawn in the window at their initial positions, but not moving. You could write a version of the <code>System</code> class for which the body of the <code>update</code> method is just the Python command <code>pass</code>, meaning to do nothing. Then you wouldn't need <code>__compute_acceleration</code> yet, either, and the update methods of the <code>Body</code> class could also just be <code>pass</code>. Eventually you have to write those methods, but not yet.</p>
<p>The first things you would write would then be the <code>__init__</code> methods for each class, and the <code>draw</code> methods for each class.</p>
<p>Once you have the drawing working, you could work more on the <code>Body</code> class, and write the two methods that update the position and velocity. Test them. For example, at first you could choose accelerations of 0, and make sure that the position update is working.</p>
<p>Once it's time to write the <code>update</code> method of <code>System</code>, take it one step at a time. Make sure that your loops loop over the correct things by adding print statements. Make sure you are computing distances and accelerations accurately. For example, an Internet search tells me that the magnitude of the acceleration of the moon toward the Earth is 0.0027 m/sec<sup>2</sup>. Is this the value you get upon the first time through the simulation? Print out the value and temporarily add a call to <code>cs1_quit</code> to your program to make sure the value you get matches this before moving on.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>You will be graded on the following criteria:</p>
<p>Correctness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bodies draw correctly: 6 points</li>
<li>Accelerations correctly calculated: 6 points</li>
<li>Velocities and positions correctly updated: 6 points</li>
<li>Solar system simulation correctly set up: 4 points</li>
</ul>
<p>Style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear design and organization: 6 points</li>
<li>Good variable names, function/method names, and comments: 6 points</li>
<li>Correct use of class methods and instance variables: 6 points</li>
</ul>
<p>As in Lab Assignment 1, correctness counts for only 22 out of 40 points. If your program works perfectly but is stylistically a mess, your grade will be low.</p>
<p>Lateness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitted between 1:46 pm and 5:00 pm Monday: –4 points.</li>
<li>Submitted between 5:01 pm Monday and 5:00 pm Tuesday: –16 points.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extra-credit-ideas">Extra credit ideas</h2>
<p>Any extra credit work should be written in separate Python files. Don't add extra credit work into your main solution code. These are just a few ideas; the first three might not be too difficult. You can make up your own ideas for extra credit.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>(10 points) Improve the look of the program by using images to draw the planets and Sun, calling the appropriate functions from cs1lib. NASA has a website with public-domain photographs of planets and the Sun. The filename of the image should probably be a parameter to the <code>__init__</code> method of a body, instead of the radius and color parameters. Remember that the image file needs to be in the same project as your Python code for <code>load_image</code> to work.</p></li>
<li><p>(5 points.) Add a new system, in a new Python file. One possibility is the Sirius AB binary star system. You can find some data online about the system, but be careful—the orbit is highly elliptical, so you'll need to make sure that the distance you initially choose between the stars matches the velocity. (If you can't find the velocity data, choose a distance, and then choose different velocities until the orbit has the right properties.)</p></li>
<li><p>(10 points) Higher-precision simulation. The accuracy of the simulator depends on the timestep, which in turn depends on the frame rate. A smaller timestep means that the simulation will be more accurate. Why? In reality, the velocities and accelerations are not constant during the timestep. You'll get less error if the timesteps are smaller. If you want to see actual error with the timesteps I've chosen, try running your Earth-moon simulation for a few minutes. (Real minutes, not simulated minutes.) If your code is right, you'll notice that the Earth drifts toward the edge of the window.</p>
<p>One way to improve the precision is to write your <code>update</code> method to subdivide the timestep it is given into many smaller timesteps, and add up the results of the smaller timesteps. For example, if the timestep given to <code>update</code> is 3333 seconds, your <code>update</code> method could compute 100 updates with timesteps of 33.33 seconds, accumulate the results, and return that value.</p></li>
<li><p>(10 points) The midpoint method. The accuracy of the simulator also is limited by the <code>x = x + t * vx</code> and <code>vx = vx + ax * t</code> type of timestep. Because the acceleration is computed only at the beginning of the timestep, the error in the velocity computation causess the planets to drift slowly away from the Sun. You can improve the update calculations using the <strong>midpoint method</strong>. Compute the acceleration at the beginning of the timestep. Then advance the simulation by one timestep (using the current velocity and timestep to move the body), and compute the acceleration again. Take the average of the accelerations that you computed at the beginning and end of the timestep. Go back to the beginning of the timestep, and use that averaged acceleration to actually do the update and get the new velocity. You can use a similar procedure to update the position using the velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>(? points) Write an educational game that allows planets to be added using the mouse. Perhaps the planets would grow more massive the longer the mouse button was held down? Or add a ship with thrusters. Be creative!</p></li>
