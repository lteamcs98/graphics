<div id = "termtitle"> CS 1:  Winter 2012 </div> 
<h1 id="review-for-final-exam">Review for Final Exam</h1>
<h2 id="ground-rules">Ground rules</h2>
<p>The final exam will be on Sunday, March 11 at 11:30 am in 008 Kemeny. <strong>Note that the exam will take place where we have our lectures, <em>not</em> where the other two exams were held!!!</strong></p>
<p>Sunday, March 11 at 11:30 am will be the <em>only</em> time that the final exam will be offered. If you cannot take it at that time, then unless you have documentation from your dean explaining why you were unable to take the exam then, you will get a score of 0 for the final exam.</p>
<p>You will have up to three hours to take the final exam.</p>
<p><strong>Also note that daylight savings time starts on March 11. You should set your clock <em>ahead</em> one hour by 2:00 am on March 11. If you forget to do so, you will be one hour late on March 11. If you arrive at the exam after 11:30 am, you will be required to complete it by 2:30 pm, regardless of the reason that you arrived late.</strong></p>
<p>As in the other two exams, you may bring a <strong>crib sheet</strong> to the exam, subject to the following restrictions. The crib sheet must be a single sheet of paper, 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches at the largest. You may write on both sides of the sheet. You may write whatever you like. But everything on the sheet must be written by you, by hand, and directly onto the sheet. Photocopying is specifically disallowed. You will hand in your crib sheet with the exam, and you will get it back with the graded exam. The crib sheet will in no way affect the grading of the exam.</p>
<h2 id="review-session">Review session</h2>
<p>There will be an open review session on Thursday, March 8, 10:00 am to 12:00 noon, in 008 Kemeny. Attendance is completely at your option. Come for as much or as little of it as you like. There is no lesson planned for this session; I will just answer all questions.</p>
<h2 id="getting-questions-answered">Getting questions answered</h2>
<p>From the end of the review session on March 8 until the morning of March 11, I will have spotty Internet access. If you have questions you want me to answer, make sure to ask them by 12:00 noon on March 8.</p>
<p>After 12:00 noon on March 8, you may send questions to the cs1help email address, but I cannot guarantee that they will be answered.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-grades">Results and grades</h2>
<p>Since we won't be able to return the final exam in class, I will announce via a email to the entire class when the final exams have been graded and the final grades have been determined. I expect this to be some time during Monday, March 12. You will find your final exam grade on the course Blackboard site once I have sent out the announcement. You may also come by my office any time after the announcement to pick up your exam. I will keep the exams until the end of the Fall 2012 term, so if you're going to be away from campus until then, you have the option of picking up your exam when you return.</p>
<p>To see your final <em>course</em> grade on Blackboard, you must first submit a course evaluation for CS 1. I have no way to check that you have submitted an evaluation, however. Therefore, we will use the following honor system: If you send me an email telling me that you have either submitted a course evaluation or explicitly opted out (you do both through bannerstudent), I will take you at your word, and I will post your final course grade on Blackboard.</p>
<p>One the luxuries of Blackboard is that you can see exactly the grades that we have recorded for you. <strong>If you believe that any of the recorded grades are incorrect and you want me to correct them, you must bring the problem to my attention <em>before the start of the final exam</em>. Bring whatever documentation you have that demonstrates we have the wrong grade recorded for you. Once the final exam starts, the grades that we have recorded for you will stand.</strong></p>
<h2 id="exam-format-and-material">Exam format and material</h2>
<p>You should know material from the entire course. Some of the questions will focus on material that we've covered since the second exam, but you should be able to answer questions and write Python code that pertains to any part of the course.</p>
<p>I do not expect you to memorize any particular pieces of code. I <em>do</em> expect you to know how to work with Python classes, lists, and dictionaries, and I expect you know how to work with linked lists.</p>
<p>Don't forget that you can link to the official course lecture notes for each lecture from the <a href="../schedule.html">schedule page</a>.</p>
<p>Read each question carefully and answer <strong>everything</strong> asked of you. Please please please read each question <strong>carefully</strong>. Many students have lost points on past exams simply because they did not read the questions carefully.</p>
<p>The exam will have a few short-answer questions and a few longer questions that may ask you to write some Python code.</p>
<h2 id="sample-questions">Sample questions</h2>
<p>Questions like these have appeared on a previous final exam. Note that I did not write any of these questions, so they won't be just like the ones on this term's exam. And, as I always remind you: <strong>Do not interpret the following as a <em>full practice exam</em>!!</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Imagine that we will use a breadth-first search to find a path from node A to node D on the graph below. List the operations that occur during the breadth-first search. For example, at some point in the search, you might have a line like &quot;add X and Y to the queue,&quot; where X and Y are the names of nodes. <em>When adding adjacent nodes to the queue, add nodes in alphabetical order.</em> Include operations such as adding a node to <code>visited</code>, and indicate when a back-pointer is created, and to which node. The last item popped from the queue should be D. When done, show the backchaining process to find a path from A to D.</p>
<p>(Hint: When writing the operations, it may be helpful to you to draw backpointers on the picture of the graph, and keep a list of items in the queue as items are pushed and popped. You may also want to draw and keep updated a representation of <code>visited</code>. Such pictures are also a good way to get partial credit.)</p>

<p>You have intercepted a secret message and also intercepted the one-time pad that was used to encrypt the message:</p>
<pre>
encrypted message: 10000010 11100010 10010101 10101010 01111111 11111101
     one-time pad: 11010101 10101011 11011011 11100100 00111010 10101111
</pre>

<p>Decrypt the message: Write down the bits of the original plaintext. Describe the procedure you use to do the decryption. Then use the table above to convert the unencyrpted bits into the original string of characters.</p></li>
<li><p>You are given the address of the first node in a linked list containing <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> items. Using big-Oh notation, give the running time to find the node that is at the midpoint of the list (for simplicity, assume that <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> is odd). Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>You are given the addresses of both the first and last nodes in a <em>singly</em> linked list containing <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> items. Because the list is singly linked, each node has the address of the node that follows it, but not the address of the previous node. Describe how you could find the address of the second-to-last node in the list. What is the running time of this operation?</p></li>
<li><p>You are given the addresses of sentinel nodes of two doubly linked lists. <code>lista</code> has <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> items, and <code>listb</code> has <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> items. Suppose that you need a list <code>listc</code> that contains all the items of <code>lista</code> followed by all of the items of <code>listb</code>. What is the running time for the fastest algorithm to create <code>listc</code>, assuming that <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> are large? Very briefly describe the main idea of your algorithm (you do not have to write any code).</p></li>
<li><p>Given the search term <code>woowow</code>,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Draw a finite automaton that would allow a text string to be searched for all occurrences of the search term.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the transition table for the finite automaton. Assume that the only two symbols in the alphabet are <code>o</code> and <code>w</code>. (Hint: the table should have seven rows, one for each of the states of the finite automaton.)</p></li>
