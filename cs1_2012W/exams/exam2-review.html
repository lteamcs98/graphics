<h1 id="review-for-exam-2">Review for Exam 2</h1>
<h2 id="ground-rules">Ground rules</h2>
<p>The second exam will be on Thursday, February 23 at 6:00 pm in Life Sciences Center, Room 100 (Oopik Auditorium). <strong>Note that the exam will take place at a location other than where we have our lectures!!!</strong></p>
<p>You will have up to three hours, but the exam is designed to take much less than three hours.</p>
<p><strong>If you cannot take the exam at 6:00 pm on February 23, you must contact me by email by 5:00 pm on Monday, February 20.</strong> If you do not contact me by then, I will require you to take the exam at 6:00 pm on Thursday. <em>No exceptions.</em> Even if you have told me before February 14 that you cannot take the exam at 6:00 pm on Thursday, you should contact me again. I might not remember something you told me two or three weeks ago.</p>
<p>As in the first exam, you may bring a <strong>crib sheet</strong> to the exam, subject to the following restrictions. The crib sheet must be a single sheet of paper, 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches at the largest. You may write on both sides of the sheet. You may write whatever you like. But everything on the sheet must be written by you, by hand, and directly onto the sheet. Photocopying is specifically disallowed. You will hand in your crib sheet with the exam, and you will get it back with the graded exam. The crib sheet will in no way affect the grading of the exam.</p>
<p>We expect to have the graded exams back to you in lecture the next day.</p>
<h2 id="review-session">Review session</h2>
<p>There will be an open review session on Thursday, February 23 during our x-hour. Attendance is completely at your option. Come for as much or as little of it as you like. There is no lesson planned for this session; I will just answer all questions.</p>
<h2 id="exam-format">Exam format</h2>
<p>The format will be much like the first exam. The second exam will cover material from the entire course, but it will emphasize material since the material covered in the first exam.</p>
<p>You should know all the material we covered through and including February 15. Don't forget that you can link to the official course lecture notes for each lecture from the <a href="../schedule.html">schedule page</a>.</p>
<p>Read each question carefully and answer <strong>everything</strong> asked of you. Please please please read each question <strong>carefully</strong>. Many students have lost points on past exams—<em>including this term's first exam</em>—simply because they did not read the questions carefully.</p>
<p>The exam will have a few short-answer questions and a few longer questions that may ask you to write some Python code.</p>
<h2 id="regrading-policy">Regrading policy</h2>
<p>Same as before.</p>
<p>If we made a mistake in adding up points, please bring it to my attention. I will correct it and update your grade in the Blackboard Grade Center.</p>
<p>If you think that we graded you unfairly, I will cheerfully regrade your entire exam upon request. Notice that what I will regrade is <em>not just the question that you think we graded unfairly.</em> I will regrade <em>the entire exam</em>.</p>
<p>I have this policy for a sound educational reason. You will get the official solutions back with your exam. You will have the official solutions, and you will have your exam. You should look over your exam and see whether there were questions on which perhaps you received credit that you should not have received. In other words, you should look over both your exam and the official solutions carefully.</p>
<p>It is possible to end up with fewer points after regrading. In fact, it happened many times in CS 5. There were even CS 5 exams where almost every regrade resulted in a lower score. So you should be confident of your solutions before you ask for a regrade.</p>
<h2 id="sample-questions">Sample questions</h2>
<p>Questions like these have appeared on a previous exam. Note that I did not write any of these questions, so they won't be just like the ones on this term's exam. And, as I always remind you: <strong>Do not interpret the following as a <em>full practice exam</em>!!</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For each part of the question, I will provide some Python code. If none of the functions or methods would crash if run, and there are no syntax errors, and none of the functions or methods contain an infinite loop, then write &quot;working code.&quot; If any of the functions or methods would crash if run, have an infinite loop, or have syntax errors, describe exactly what the problem is with the code, and how it might be fixed. <strong>There may be more than one error in each question. Describe all errors.</strong> No credit will be given unless the explanation of errors is correct. You do not need to comment on the style of the code (whitespace, function names, variable names).</p>

<li><p>Assume that you have a list with the values, in order, 18, 14, 12, 6, 22, 19, 11, 1. You call <code>merge_sort</code> on the list. During the merge sorting process, the <code>merge</code> function will be called several times. Write down the values in the list (in order) after each call to <code>merge</code>, in the order that merge calls are made by Python. (<em>Hint:</em> It might be helpful to first draw the recursion tree for <code>merge_sort</code>, labeling the order in which calls to <code>merge</code> are made and the parameters to each <code>merge</code> call.)</p></li>
<li><p>Step through the following code, drawing the run-time stack as you go. As each stack frame is popped from the stack, <em>lightly</em> cross out the frame (so that we can still see any values in it), and write the return value from the function to the right of the frame. Do not forget to write the name of the function corresponding to each stack frame.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> magic(x, y, z):<br />    <span class="kw">return</span> mystery(x, y, z) + <span class="dv">3</span> * mayhem(<span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)   <br /><br /><span class="kw">def</span> mystery(z, q, r):<br />    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="dv">2</span> * mayhem(z + q, r)<br /><br /><span class="kw">def</span> mayhem(x, a):<br />    <span class="kw">return</span> x * a<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> magic(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I've written some code below to simulate a deck of cards. There are four <strong>suits</strong> of cards: clubs, spades, diamonds, and hearts. In each suit, there are 13 card <strong>values</strong>: cards with numbers 1 through 10, the Jack (11), the Queen (12), and the King (13). A standard deck has 52 cards: one of each value, for each suit. (We ignore the Joker.)</p>
<p>Write two classes: the <code>Card</code> class, and the <code>Deck</code> class. I wrote some simple code to test the classes. I've included the test code, but I have not given you the code for the classes. Write the classes so that my test code works, and so that the output is exactly as described in the comments of the test code.</p>
<p>A few hints. First, you can use the <code>randint(min, max)</code> function to pick a random number between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>, inclusive of both <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>. Second, you can reorder (shuffle) a list by looping over the list, swapping each item into a random location. Third, the method <code>pop</code> removes the last item from a list and returns the value of that item. Finally, to see what methods you <em>must</em> write, you will have to read the test code carefully. You are welcome to write other methods if you need to do so. When you are done writing the classes, I advise you to step through the test code, making sure output is exactly what is expected.</p>
