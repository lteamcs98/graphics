<h1 id="lists-and-for-loops">Lists and for-loops</h1>
<p>So far, we've needed a new variable name for each new piece of information we wanted to store. A <strong>list</strong> is a Python data type that can store multiple pieces of information, in order, and with a single variable name. The list name, together with a non-negative integer can then be used to refer to the individual items of data. Let's start with an example, in <a href="moons.py">moons.py</a>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># Create a new list, and initialize the list to contain several strings</span><br />moons = [<span class="st">&quot;Io&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Europa&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ganymede&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Callisto&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Iapetus&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ione&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Tethys&quot;</span>]<br /><br /><span class="co"># Print a few items of the list</span><br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The first moon in the list is &quot;</span> + moons[<span class="dv">0</span>] + <span class="st">&quot;.&quot;</span><br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The second moon in the list is &quot;</span> + moons[<span class="dv">1</span>] + <span class="st">&quot;.&quot;</span><br /><br /><span class="co"># Print the entire list</span><br /><span class="kw">print</span> moons</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we can use <code>moons[0]</code> and <code>moons[1]</code> as if they were variables in their own right.</p>
<p>There are two main uses of lists:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Storing large amounts of similar data using just one name for the list.</li>
<li>Applying similar operations to many pieces of data.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="creating-lists">Creating lists</h2>
<p>You can type a list in using brackets and commas.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span> [<span class="st">&quot;Bach&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Beethoven&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Mozart&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Lady Gaga&quot;</span>]<br /><span class="kw">print</span> [<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>, <span class="dv">42</span>, <span class="dv">19</span>, <span class="dv">26</span>]</code></pre>
<p>When the Python interpreter reaches the brackets, Python allocates space in memory for the items in the list. Of course, usually there's not much point in just printing out a list created this way; we'd like to be able to refer to the list with a variable name. The assignment operator <code>=</code> copies the address of the list object in memory into the variable on the left hand side:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">storybook_characters = [<span class="st">&quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Gurgi&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;The Grinch&quot;</span>]</code></pre>
<p>So, strictly speaking, it's incorrect to say &quot;<code>storybook_characters</code> is a list.&quot; Instead, the correct thing to say is &quot;<code>storybook_characters</code> holds the address in memory of a list.&quot; Although the difference between &quot;is a list&quot; and &quot;holds the address in memory of a list&quot; might seem subtle right now, we'll see that there's definitely a difference.</p>
<p>You can also create an empty list.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">worst_things_about_cs1 = []</code></pre>
<p>For now, we don't have much use for empty lists, but we'll soon see that we can start with an empty list and then add items to it.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-items-of-a-list">Accessing items of a list</h2>
<p>Once a list has been created and its address assigned to a variable, you will want to do things with individual items of the list. We use square brackets to <strong>index</strong> into a list. The first list element is at index 0 (because that's how computer scientists like to count: starting from 0), so to get the 0th item in the list, follow the name of the list variable with square brackets containing the number 0. Here's a snippet of code in <a href="storybook.py">storybook.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">storybook_characters = [<span class="st">&quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Gurgi&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;The Grinch&quot;</span>]<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> storybook_characters[<span class="dv">0</span>]<br />storybook_characters[<span class="dv">1</span>] = <span class="st">&quot;Eyeore&quot;</span><br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> storybook_characters</code></pre>
<p>What goes within the brackets can be any expression that evaluates to an int that is in the range of the indices:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">i = <span class="dv">5</span><br /><span class="kw">print</span> storybook_characters[<span class="dv">2</span> * i - <span class="dv">9</span>]   <span class="co"># prints &quot;Gurgi&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that list items can really be treated as variables. You can use the assignment operator to change an item in a list (<code>storybook_characters[1] = &quot;Eyeore&quot;</code>). Here is another example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">some_numbers = [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>]<br />some_numbers[<span class="dv">0</span>] = some_numbers[<span class="dv">2</span>] + some_numbers[<span class="dv">3</span>]<br /><span class="kw">print</span> some_numbers</code></pre>
<p><code>some_numbers[2]</code> has the value 8 (remember, we start counting, or indexing, the list, from 0). <code>some_number[3]</code> has the value 12. After adding, we get 20, and assign that value to the 0th item of the list. Printing the result gives</p>
<pre><code>[20, 4, 8, 12]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="common-programming-error-list-index-out-of-range">Common programming error: List index out of range</h3>
<p>If you forget that the list is indexed from 0, or for some other reason try to access an item of the list at an index beyond the end of the list, Python will abort your program and print an error message.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">storybook_characters = [<span class="st">&quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Gurgi&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;The Grinch&quot;</span>]<br /><span class="kw">print</span> storybook_characters[<span class="dv">3</span>]     <span class="co"># fails, because list only contains items [0], [1], and [2]</span></code></pre>
<p>This is a very common type of programming error. If you get an error like</p>
<pre><code>IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>from Python, step through your code by hand near the line where Python reports an error, and figure out how you managed to ask for a list index that isn't in the list. There are two cases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You asked for an item at the index you intended, but somehow didn't originally put the item into the list.</li>
<li>You put the correct items into the list, but made a mistake in computing or choosing the index.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-length-of-a-list">The length of a list</h2>
<p>You can find out how many items are in a list using the Python built-in function <code>len</code>. Here's an example, in <a href="len.py">len.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">moons = [<span class="st">&quot;Io&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Europa&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ganymede&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Callisto&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Iapetus&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ione&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Tethys&quot;</span>]<br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The length of the list </span><span class="ch">\'</span><span class="st">moons</span><span class="ch">\'</span><span class="st"> is &quot;</span> + <span class="dt">str</span>(<span class="dt">len</span>(moons)) + <span class="st">&quot;.&quot;</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="iterating-over-a-list-with-a-while-loop">Iterating over a list with a while-loop</h2>
<p>A list is a way of organizing, or structuring, data that your program will use. We say that a list is a <strong>data structure</strong>, and we will see many other examples of data structures later in the course. One of the key principles of a data structure is that the data structure allows you to apply operations to some or all of the data in a unified way.</p>
<p>Let's take an example. You decide to start a new website, <code>www.warmhanoverweather.com</code>. (Please remember to put me on the board of directors and send me a nice cut of the profits.) Initially, daily temperatures are recorded in Fahrenheit.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">temperatures = [<span class="dv">9</span>, <span class="dv">14</span>, <span class="dv">18</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">16</span>, -<span class="dv">11</span>]</code></pre>
<p>But then next month, the United States decides to convert to the Celsius scale, leaving Belize as the only country using the Fahrenheit scale. You decide to convert all of your temperatures to Celsius. You could do it this way, in <a href="fahr2cels1.py">fahr2cels1.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> fahrenheit_to_celsius(tempf):<br />    <span class="co"># (note -- floating point division, not integer division!)</span><br />    <span class="kw">return</span> (tempf - <span class="dv">32</span>) * <span class="fl">5.0</span> / <span class="fl">9.0</span>     <br /><br />temperatures = [<span class="dv">9</span>, <span class="dv">14</span>, <span class="dv">18</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, -<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">16</span>]<br /><br />temperatures[<span class="dv">0</span>] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[<span class="dv">0</span>])<br />temperatures[<span class="dv">1</span>] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[<span class="dv">1</span>])<br />temperatures[<span class="dv">2</span>] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[<span class="dv">2</span>])<br />temperatures[<span class="dv">3</span>] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[<span class="dv">3</span>])<br />temperatures[<span class="dv">4</span>] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[<span class="dv">4</span>])<br />temperatures[<span class="dv">5</span>] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[<span class="dv">5</span>])<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> temperatures</code></pre>
<p>(Notice the floating-point inaccuracies. I told you so …)</p>
<p>You are doing the same type of operation over and over again. Convert <code>temperatures[0]</code>. Convert <code>temperatures[1]</code>. Convert <code>temperatures[2]</code>. And so on. You could use a loop, and replace six statements like so, in <a href="fahr2cels2.py">fahr2cels2.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">index = <span class="dv">0</span><br /><span class="kw">while</span> index &lt; <span class="dt">len</span>(temperatures):<br />    temperatures[index] = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperatures[index])<br />    index = index + <span class="dv">1</span></code></pre>
<p>This while-loop would work for even a very long list of temperatures.</p>
<h2 id="an-algorithm-design-and-implementation-example-reversing-a-list">An algorithm design and implementation example: Reversing a list</h2>
<p>Let's look at an example in which we want to reverse a list. Recall from our first lecture that a fully specified step-by-step strategy for solving a problem in computer science is called an <strong>algorithm</strong>. The first step to solving a problem is to think about how we might solve it as a human, as precisely as possible. Once each step has been fully specified, we have <strong>designed</strong> an algorithm. We then translate that algorithm into runnable code, thereby <strong>implementing</strong> the algorithm.</p>
<p>There are two choices for our <em>reverse_list</em> algorithm:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a new, reversed copy of the list, leaving the original list intact.</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse the list &quot;in place.&quot; If we do it this way, there is only one list, and at the end of the operation, the items of the list are in reversed order. We say that this operation is <strong>in place</strong> because the items never leave the list they started in.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We'll use the second approach and reverse the list in place, since I haven't yet told you how to make a new list of the correct size.</p>
<p>Now let's think about how to reverse the list in place. What's our target?</p>
<p>We want the first item to be in the last item's spot, and vice versa. We want the second item to be in the current second-to-last item's spot, and vice versa. So here is a first attempt at our algorithm specification, in English (or pseudo-code):</p>
<pre><code>for every item in the list:
   swap the item with the corresponding item from the end of the list
</code></pre>
<p>Will it work? Let's walk through it in our heads for a list of length 6. Start by swapping the first item with the sixth. Good. Swap the second item with the fifth. Good. Swap the third item with the fourth. Good. The next item is the fourth item. Houston, we have a problem. After we swapped the third item with the fourth, we actually were done—the list was reversed. If we then swap the fourth with the third, as our first attempt at an algorithm seems to specify, we put them back to where they were when we started. We have begun to undo our reversal of the list items. We need to modify our algorithm so that it stops after swapping only half of the items in the list.</p>
<pre><code>for the first half of the items in the list:
   swap the item with the corresponding item from the second half of the list
</code></pre>
<p>There's one more thing we should be nervous about. A list of length 6 has a first half and a second half, each of size 3. What if we had a list of length 7? What's the first half? What's the second? How many swaps should we do? Well, the item that is precisely in the middle of an odd-length list doesn't get changed by reversing the list. So for a list of length 7, we need to do only 3 swaps. If the list length is odd, the number of swaps is the length of the list, divided by 2, and rounded down. If the list length is even, the number of swaps is the length of the list divided by 2. So our final algorithm design is:</p>
<pre><code>for the first half (rounded down) of the items in the list:
   swap the item with the corresponding item from the second half of the list
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's implement the reverse_list algorithm in Python code. We need to loop through the first half (rounded down) of the list. We can use a while-loop for that. Here's how, in <a href="reverse_list.py">reverse_list.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># List reverse example for cs1</span><br /><span class="co"># Devin Balkcom</span><br /><span class="co"># August 2011 </span><br /><br /><span class="co"># An example list</span><br />l = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>, <span class="dv">9</span>, <span class="dv">11</span>, <span class="dv">13</span>, <span class="dv">15</span>]<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The list before reversing:  &quot;</span> + <span class="dt">str</span>(l)<br /><br />index = <span class="dv">0</span><br /><span class="kw">while</span> index &lt; <span class="dt">len</span>(l) / <span class="dv">2</span>:<br />    <span class="co"># We'll call the index of the item to swap with the right_index,</span><br />    <span class="co"># since it's the index into the right half of the list.</span><br /><br />    <span class="co"># Because indices start at 0, the last item of the list is at </span><br />    <span class="co"># index len(l) - 1.</span><br />    right_index = <span class="dt">len</span>(l) - <span class="dv">1</span> - index<br /><br />    <span class="co"># Swap the items at index and right_index.</span><br />    temp = l[index]  <span class="co"># store the value at l[index] before clobbering</span><br />    l[index] = l[right_index]<br />    l[right_index] = temp<br /><br />    index = index + <span class="dv">1</span><br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The list after reversing:  &quot;</span> + <span class="dt">str</span>(l)</code></pre>
<p>There are a few tricky things to notice. First, we can accomplish the rounding down of the index of the middle item of the list by just using integer division (<code>while index &lt; len(l) / 2:</code>).</p>
<p>Also, because indices in a list start at 0, we have to be careful about computing the index into the second half of the list. It's good to check an example. Suppose the list <code>l</code> has length 8. Then the index of the last item should be 7. So we should use <code>len(l) - 1</code>, and then subtract the current index to get the index into the second half of the list. Work it out: if the index is 0, then <code>len(l) - 1 - 0</code> gives 7. If the index is 1, then <code>len(l) - 1 - 1</code> gives 6. If the index is 2, then <code>len(l) - 1 - 2</code> gives 5. And so on. So it works out.</p>
<p>The final thing to notice is how we swap items. We need a temporary variable to hold one of the values. Suppose you tried something like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">l[index] = l[right_index]<br />l[right_index] = l[index]</code></pre>
<p>The both items of the list would end up having the same value after the first line, and the original value of <code>l[index]</code> has been irrevocably lost.</p>
<p>If needing a temporary variable confuses you, think of it this way. Suppose that Nicole and I want to exchange the positions of the two cars in our two-car garage. My Chevy starts on the left side, and her Honda starts on the right. I can't just pull my Chevy out and put it in the right side. No, I have to pull my Chevy out, leave it in the driveway (the temporary storage), then put her Honda in the left side, and finally move my Chevy to the right side.</p>
<h2 id="for-loops">for-loops</h2>
<p>We often use a loop to work with items of a list when programming. This section introduces a new type of loop, called a for-loop, that is particularly well suited to dealing with items of a list. Anything you can accomplish with a for-loop you can also accomplish with a while-loop, so we are not getting any more power out of for-loops. But we'll see that they are easier to read and to type. Alternate, briefer ways of expressing the same thing in code are called <strong>syntactic sugar</strong>, because they're just a sweet extra.</p>
<p>Before we get to for-loops, let's look at another example with a while-loop. A particularly common case is when you would like to use each item in a list, but do not want to actually change the list. Here is an example of simply printing out all of the items of a list, in <a href="moons_while.py">moons_while.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">moons = [<span class="st">&quot;Io&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Europa&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ganymede&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Callisto&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Iapetus&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ione&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Tethys&quot;</span>]<br /><br />index = <span class="dv">0</span><br /><span class="kw">while</span> index &lt; <span class="dt">len</span>(moons):<br />    moon = moons[index]<br />    <span class="kw">print</span> moon<br />    index = index + <span class="dv">1</span></code></pre>
<p>You might notice that in the above loop, the variable <code>index</code> is never used on its own; it's a variable that is introduced solely for the purpose of getting items. You never print out <code>index</code>, you don't compute anything with it, and you really don't care what its value is. You just want to get each item of the <code>moons</code> list and print it. You also don't really care about <code>len(moons)</code>. Yes, you need to use it to know when to terminate the while loop, but who cares what the actual value is? (I also introduced a variable <code>moon</code> to store the list item, and then worked with that temporary variable. There was no real reason not to just print out <code>moons[index]</code> directly, but this temporary variable will help clarify the explanation of for-loops.)</p>
<p>If you were describing the method for printing out the names of moons at a high level, you might say (in English) something like, &quot;For every item of the <code>moons</code> list, print out that item.&quot; You might not tell me about initializing <code>index</code>, about the mechanical detail of incrementing <code>index</code> each time through the loop, or about comparing <code>index</code> to <code>len(moons)</code>. Humans don't think like that. We can hide these details with a for-loop.</p>
<p>A <strong>for-loop</strong> iterates over items in a list, making each item available in sequence. Here is an example, in <a href="moons_for.py">moons_for.py</a>, that acts identically to the example with the while-loop:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">moons = [<span class="st">&quot;Io&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Europa&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ganymede&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Callisto&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Iapetus&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ione&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Tethys&quot;</span>]<br /><br /><span class="kw">for</span> moon in moons:<br />    <span class="kw">print</span> moon</code></pre>
<p>With a for-loop, you don't need to create an index variable, increment the index variable, or compare the index variable to the length of the list. Python does that stuff for you internally, behind the scenes. There are a couple of key things to notice.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you actually want the value of the index, you can't determine it during the for-loop. You'll need to use a while-loop.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot change the <code>moons</code> list during a for-loop. Each item is <em>copied</em> into the temporary variable <code>moon</code>. You can change <code>moon</code> if you like, but that won't change the list. If you want to change the list, you'll need to use a while-loop.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because for-loops are simpler and easier to read, you should use a for-loop in your code wherever the goal is to refer to the items of a list, but without changing the list. If you want to change which items the list contains, you should use a while-loop.</p>
<h2 id="using-range-to-create-a-list-of-int-values">Using <code>range</code> to create a list of <code>int</code> values</h2>
<p>Some functions return lists. For example, the built-in Python function <code>range</code> gives ints in a specified range. (By built-in, I mean that you don't even have to import it from anywhere.) For example, <code>range(3, 10)</code> gives the list</p>
<pre><code>[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

<p><code>range</code> can save you some typing if you want to count over integers. Here's an example, in <a href="interest.py">interest.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">RATE = <span class="fl">1.05</span><br />YEAR = <span class="dv">2012</span><br />balance = <span class="fl">1.0</span><br /><br /><span class="kw">for</span> year in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, YEAR):<br />    balance = balance *  RATE<br /><br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The balance is &quot;</span> + <span class="dt">str</span>(balance) + <span class="st">&quot;.&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>If you only give range one parameter, then the list will start at 0.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>)</code></pre>
<p>would give</p>
<pre><code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="you-can-treat-a-string-like-a-list-sort-of">You can treat a string like a list (sort of)</h2>
<p>You can get a character from a string almost as though the string were a list:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">mystring = <span class="st">&quot;Chevy!&quot;</span><br /><span class="kw">print</span> <span class="st">&quot;The fifth character in &quot;</span> + mystring + <span class="st">&quot; is &quot;</span> + mystring[<span class="dv">4</span>].  </code></pre>
<p>You can even loop over characters in a string, as in <a href="for_string.py">for_string.py</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode python">mystring = <span class="st">&quot;Chevy!&quot;</span><br /><span class="kw">for</span> char in mystring:<br />    <span class="kw">print</span> char</code></pre>
<p>You might think you could change a character in a string this way too. It won't work. <code>mystring[3] = 'r'</code> will give an error. Python strings are <strong>immutable</strong>; their values cannot be changed.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do something like changing the third letter to <em>r</em>, you would have to build an entirely new string, using the old string and the new letter. We'll see how to do that later in the course.</p>
